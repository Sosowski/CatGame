ABOUT THE DAMAGE KNOCKBACK
The way it is currently coded, the player will be thrown back upon taking damage.
The horizonal movement keys are disabled if the knockback is still deaccelerating.
HOWEVER
If the player hits an x level border, the knockback is reset.
If this time the player is still holding down the opposite movement key,
he will spring off the wall at it's default 10 units.
PROPOSED
Keep this feature, allowing the player to jump off platforms or walls
after being hit and get right back into gameplay if the correct key
is still depressed on impact. Will require some extra collision coding.

Other notes:
Use relative directories somehow for include? The folder thing implemented doesn't wanna build.
$(ProjectDir)CatGame\Headers
or something like that?
